        <h3>The context</h3>
        <p>As per survey by AICTE, there is a large gap between the skill-set acquired by the students 
            and requirements of industry. To bridge this gap it is essential to ensure programming 
            competency among students is to enhance the employability skills of the students for 
            placement in software industry. In this context students are required to acquire higher level 
            programming skills to compete with the rest to be successful. With a large diversity in the 
            domain of programming like programming paradigms, platforms and practices and much 
            more evolutionary, there is a need to group like-minded aspirants to enhance their coding 
            skills accordingly. This provides the required platform for student to choose a domain of his 
            choice and work on it accordingly. This provides a platform for the student to understand 
            the skills required in the domain and the intricacies in problem solving approaches
